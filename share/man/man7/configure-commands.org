#+TITLE:configure-commands

* NAME

configure-commands - configure commands for various programs

* TIPS

When a =./configure= says it found something but it doesn't work because it
wasn't able to build a test program with it, go look at the logs.  That test
program may be using a specific feature that needs to be activated.  See
NCURSES.

* NCURSES

#+begin_src shell
./configure --prefix=PREFIX --with-termlib --enable-termcap --enable-widec \
            --enable-pc-files --with-pkg-config-libdir=PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig
#+end_src

The =./configure= for tig found ncurses but said it was no good because its
test program uses =libtinfo.{a/so}=.  I had to look at the logs to find that
the error was at linking: =ld: Could not find -ltinfo=.

* LYNX

[[https://lynx.invisible-island.net/lynx_help/lynx_help_main.html]]

#+begin_src shell
./configure --with-ssl --prefix=<>
#+end_src

NOTE: Redoing it with =--with-ssl= after doing it without doesn't work.
